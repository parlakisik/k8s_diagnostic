# CIDR-Based L3 Network Policies

This directory contains Cilium network policies that utilize CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) based selectors to control traffic based on IP address ranges.

## Policies Included

- **cidr-egress-policy.yaml**: Demonstrates how to restrict egress traffic to specific IP CIDR ranges
- **cidr-ingress-policy.yaml**: Shows how to control ingress traffic from specific IP CIDR ranges
- **cidr-with-except-policy.yaml**: Illustrates using CIDR blocks with exceptions, allowing more granular control over network traffic
